KeePassJS
=========

An online version of KeePass forked from BrowsePass

KeePassJS is designed to make it easier for people to access their password databases stored in the cloud or localy. It has built in Dropbox integration making loading passwords from the cloud easier than ever before. Although this application is written purely in Javascript/HTML/CSS it must be run via a web server for development testing because of requirements of the Dropbox API. I recommend WAMP which is a popular and easy to use web server for Linux and Windows operating systems.
